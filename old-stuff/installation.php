<h3>Tabbie Installation Guide</h3>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<div>
First of all - don't worry. Even though this page may seem a bit overwhelming, it really shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to get Tabbie started. It's really been designed to run straight out of the box.
</div>

<div>
If you use some kind of Unix/Linux we'll expect you to know what to do on your particular system. You can skip straight to <a href="#requirements">the requirements</a>.
</div>

<div>
If you use windows and already have a webserver, you can <a href="#step2">skip step 1</a>. If you use Windows, and have no idea what a web server is, read the whole guide. If you run into problems that you cannot solve by yourself and the nerds you have befriended, go to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tabbie/">Tabbie Project Page</a> and ask for support there. Since the above page may be a bit intimidating (it is even for us) you can also just send a mail to <i>klaas aat vanschelven doot com</i>
</div>

<h3>Step 1: Install a Web Server</h3>
<div>
Tabbie is Web Based Software, which is a really fancy way of saying that it's a bunch of web pages. These pages are written in a language called PHP and a mysql database is used to store data. Unlike regular HTML pages, PHP pages may execute commands and can therefor be used as an interactive interface.
</div>
 
<div>
To make the PHP pages actually do show up as something else than a bunch of boring text pages, we need a Web Server to run them on. If you already have a webserver running you can skip this step.
</div>
 
<div>
If not - no worries - webservers come nicely packaged these days. One example of such a server which runs under Windows is EasyPHP, which can be download at <a href="http://www.easyphp.org/">www.easyphp.org</a>. If you don't feel like browsing their site you can also get <a href="http://www.easyphp.org/telechargements/dn.php?F=easyphp1-8">version 1.8 (7.7 MB)</a> directly.
</div>

<div>
Now - run the installer and install it in some location of your liking. Basically, just press OK many times. In the following, we will assume you have chosen C:\Program&nbsp;Files\EasyPHP1-8 as the root location of EasyPHP. It's fine to install elsewhere, just make sure you replace C:\Program&nbsp;Files\EasyPHP1-8 by the correct location.
</div>
 
<div>
If you've finished this step correctly you should be able to go to <a href="http://localhost/" target="_blank">http://localhost/</a> and see EasyPHP's opening page.
</div>
 
<h3><a name="step2"></a>Step 2: Download Tabbie</h3>
<div>Download the latest version of Tabbie on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199347">Sourceforge</a>. The highest stable release in a file format that seems familiar should be just fine.</div>
 
<h3>Step 3: Unpack Tabbie</h3>
Use your favourite tool to extract the contents of the downloaded Tabbie file to C:\Program&nbsp;Files\EasyPHP1-8\www. If you did this correctly you should see a directory "tabbie" in C:\Program&nbsp;Files\EasyPHP1-8\www. Also, opening <a href="http://localhost/tabbie/" target="_blank">http://localhost/tabbie/</a> should bring up a site remarkably similar to this one - this is your live Installation. (Go there to start using Tabbie)

<h3>Step 4: Install Tabbie</h3>
<div>
On your installed version of Tabbie click on the "Run" option, (if you closed the window: <a href="http://localhost/tabbie/run/" target="_blank">http://localhost/tabbie/run/</a>. You will get a bunch of options - if you don't know what these mean, just click on the install button. By this time, your screen should be Filled with succesful database statements, followed by a big "Installation Succesful" remark.
</div>

<h3>Step 5: Security</h3>
<div>
Tabbie itself does no attempt to restrict certain people from seeing what's going on. This means you'll have to configure your computer and network so that no-one else can edit. If you have no idea how to do this - this is really the moment to get help from an expert/nerd in your personal environment. She will also be able to tell you how you can allow others to access Tabbie on your computer.
</div>

<h3>Step 6: Additional tips and options</h3>
<div>
Since all versions of Tabbie run on exactly the same database architecture, you can install simulanious versions in different directories for extra reliability. In the very unlikely case that a feature does not work in the newest version, or that you don't like 'improved' functionality, you can then always fall back to an older version. Make sure to either run all installations before starting or to copy the config file - running an installation midway in the tournament will erase all your data.
</div>

<h3>Step 7: Start inputting data</h3>
<div>
This is really where the install ends....and using Tabbie begins. Should you have any problems, please visit the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tabbie/">Tabbie Project Page</a> and ask for support there.
</div>

<h3><a name="requirements"></a>System Requirements</h3>
<div>
Tabbie requires PHP 4 and MySql 4.1. Unix/Linux system administrators may want to run the script run/setpermissions.sh or inspect it to see which file permissions to set.
