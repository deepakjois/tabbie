AJAX & Tabbie
Developer Note
Giles Robertson, June 2009

Adding Ajax to Tabbie requires some architectural changes, mainly because <head/> must now vary with each page as different scripts are used.

Therefore the following directory structure is proposed:
/ajax - subdirectory for dynamic javascript, subdivided by ntu_controller and ntu_module (hence /ajax/input/adjud.js)
/js - static javascript, which may over time replace /view/scrolling/javascripts
/controller - for php handling server-side of ajax

All of this is handled by new code in ntu_controller.php and header.php
